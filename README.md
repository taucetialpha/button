# App to learn how to lift up state in React

This is a simple app for me to learn how to lift up state in React.

This app has a header and a boxy. Clicking on the header button displays four buttons in the body. The objective is to be able to toggle each of these buttons and retain their on/off status in state. This is what I am having trouble achieving.

Steps:
- App.js loads Header.jsx
- Clicking on button in Header.jsx maps the data in BoxData.json onto a template in Box.jsx.
- In Body.jsx, a box with a clickable button is displayed for each box in BoxData.json.
